    - Class ID (class_uid): The unique identifier of a class. A Class describes the attributes available in an event.
    - Cloud (cloud) [Optional]: Describes details about the Cloud environment where the event was originally created or logged.
    - Container (container) [Optional]: Describes the container details.
    - Count (count) [Optional]: Number of times similar events occurred within a specified timeframe.
    - Duration (duration) [Optional]: Time span of the event, from start to end, in milliseconds.
    - Event Time (time) [Required]: The standardized time when the event occurred or the finding was created.
    - Evidence Artifacts (evidences) [Optional]: Artifacts related to the security detection activities.
    - Impact (impact) [Optional]: The impact, normalized to the caption of the impact_id value. In the case of 'Other', it is defined by the event source.
    - Impact Score (impact_score) [Optional]: The impact of the finding, valid range 0-100.
