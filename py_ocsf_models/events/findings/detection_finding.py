class DetectionFinding(Finding, BaseModel):
    """
    A Detection Finding describes detections or alerts generated by security products using correlation engines, detection engines or other methodologies. Note: if the product is a security control, the security_control profile should be applied and its attacks information should be duplicated into the finding_info object.

    Attributes:
    - Affected Resources (resources) [Recommended]: Describes details about resources that were the target of the activity that triggered the finding.
    - Category (category_name): The event category name, as defined by category_uid value: Findings.
    - Class (class_name) [Optional]: The event class name, as defined by class_uid value: Detection Finding.
    - Class ID (class_uid): The unique identifier of a class. A Class describes the attributes available in an event.
    - Cloud (cloud) [Optional]: Describes details about the Cloud environment where the event was originally created or logged.
    - Count (count) [Optional]: Number of times similar events occurred within a specified timeframe.
    - Duration (duration) [Optional]: Time span of the event, from start to end, in milliseconds.
    - Event Time (time) [Required]: The standardized time when the event occurred or the finding was created.
    - Event Time (time_dt) [Optional]: The standardized time when the event occurred or the finding was created, in datetime format.
    - Evidence Artifacts (evidences) [Optional]: Artifacts related to the security detection activities.
    - Impact (impact) [Optional]: The impact, normalized to the caption of the impact_id value. In the case of 'Other', it is defined by the event source.
    - Impact Score (impact_score) [Optional]: The impact of the finding, valid range 0-100.
    - Impact ID (impact_id) [Optional]: The normalized impact of the finding.
    - Remediation Guidance (remediation) [Optional]: Suggested steps to address the finding.
    - Risk Level (risk_level) [Optional]: The risk level, normalized to the caption of the risk_level_id value. In the case of 'Other', it is defined by the event source.
    - Risk Level ID (risk_level_id) [Optional]: The normalized risk level id.
    - Risk Score (risk_score) [Optional]: The risk score as reported by the event source.
    - Risk Details (risk_details) [Optional]: Additional details about the risk.
    - Status ID (status_id) [Optional]: The normalized identifier of the event/finding severity.
    - Timezone Offset (timezone_offset) [Optional]: Difference in minutes from UTC.
    - Type ID (type_uid): The event/finding type ID. It identifies the event's semantics and structure. The value is calculated by the logging system as: class_uid * 100 + activity_id.
    - Type Name (type_name) [Optional]: The event/finding type name, as defined by the type_uid.
    - Vulnerabilities (vulnerabilities) [Optional]: Vulnerabilities identified in the finding.

    If the Cloud profile is needed:
        - API Details (api) [Optional]: Describes details about a typical API (Application Programming Interface) call.
        - Cloud (cloud): Describes details about the Cloud environment where the event was originally created or logged
